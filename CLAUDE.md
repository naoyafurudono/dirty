This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

"dirty" is an effect system for Go implemented as a static analysis tool. It tracks function side effects through `// dirty:` comment annotations.

## Key Concepts

```go
// dirty: select[user]
func GetUser(id int64) (User, error) { ... }

// dirty: select[user], select[member]
func GetUserWithMember(userID int64) (User, []Member, error) { ... }
```

**Rules:**

- Functions must declare ALL effects (including those from called functions)
- Multiple effects are comma-separated
- Effect labels are treated as opaque tokens (e.g., `select[user]`)

## Implementation Status

**Completed:** âœ…
- Basic effect checking at call sites
- Implicit effect calculation for undeclared functions
- Method call support
- Circular dependency handling
- Error reporting with detailed diagnostics (DIRTY_VERBOSE=1)
- sqlc-use integration for automatic database effect detection

**Next:** Performance optimization, cross-package analysis

```

## Testing

Run tests with: `make test` or `go test ./...`

Keep code base to pass all tests.
